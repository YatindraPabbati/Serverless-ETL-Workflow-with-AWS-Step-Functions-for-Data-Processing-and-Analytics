## Serverless ETL Workflow with AWS Step Functions for Data Processing and Analytics (code to be uploaded soon...)

### Overview
This project builds a **Serverless ETL Pipeline** that collects IoT telemetry data, processes it using AWS Lambda, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline uses several AWS services like **AWS Step Functions**, **AWS Lambda**, **AWS IoT Core**, **Amazon S3**, **Amazon SQS**, **CloudWatch**, and **pgAdmin** for monitoring and database management.

### Prerequisites
- An **AWS account** with access to AWS services such as IoT Core, S3, Lambda, Step Functions, SQS, and CloudWatch.
- An instance of **pgAdmin** for PostgreSQL database management.
- **IAM roles** with permissions to allow services to interact with each other (e.g., Lambda functions accessing S3, IoT Core, and SQS).

### Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Your S3 Bucket

1. **Go to the S3 Console**:
   - Navigate to the [Amazon S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3).
   
2. **Create a new S3 bucket**:
   - Click **Create Bucket**.
   - Give your bucket a unique name (e.g., `my-etl-bucket`).
   - Choose the region where you want to store your data.
   - Optionally, enable versioning to keep track of changes in data.
   - Set up permissions (make sure Lambda has access to the bucket later).
   
3. **Bucket Usage**: This bucket will store both raw telemetry data and processed results.

### Step 2: Set Up IoT Core for Simulated Device Data

1. **Create an IoT Thing**:
   - Go to the [AWS IoT Core console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot).
   - Under **Manage**, select **Things** and click **Create**.
   - Follow the wizard to create a new IoT Thing. This represents your device (even though you don’t have physical hardware, we’ll simulate the device).

2. **Generate Certificates**:
   - During Thing creation, generate new certificates and download them. These certificates will be used to securely connect your simulated device to AWS IoT Core.
   - Attach the IoT policy to allow the device to publish telemetry data to IoT Core.
   
3. **Simulate Device Data**:
   - Since we don’t have a physical device, use a **Python script** to simulate the sending of telemetry data (e.g., temperature, humidity). The script will connect to AWS IoT Core and publish data at regular intervals.

### Step 3: Set Up SQS for Message Queuing

1. **Go to the SQS Console**:
   - Navigate to the [SQS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs).
   - Click **Create Queue** and choose a **Standard Queue**.
   
2. **Queue Configuration**:
   - Give the queue a name (e.g., `iot-telemetry-queue`).
   - Set the default visibility timeout and other settings based on your needs.
   
3. **IAM Permissions**:
   - Ensure your Lambda functions will have the necessary permissions to **read** from the SQS queue.

---

### Step 4: Create Lambda Functions for ETL

1. **Create Lambda Functions**:
   - Go to the [AWS Lambda console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda).
   - Click **Create Function** and choose the **Author from Scratch** option.
   - For each function, set the runtime (Python is commonly used) and name the functions (e.g., `DataExtractionFunction`, `DataTransformationFunction`, `DataLoadingFunction`).

2. **Function 1: Data Extraction**:
   - This function will read telemetry data from the **SQS queue**.
   - It will download the incoming telemetry data and save it to the S3 bucket.

3. **Function 2: Data Transformation**:
   - This function will read raw data from the S3 bucket, clean or process it (e.g., convert JSON to a structured format), and store the processed data back in S3.

4. **Function 3: Data Loading**:
   - This function will read the processed data from the S3 bucket and load it into the **PostgreSQL database**.
   - Use **pgAdmin** to create a PostgreSQL database and a table to store telemetry data.

---

### Step 5: Set Up PostgreSQL Database with pgAdmin

1. **Install and Configure pgAdmin**:
   - If not already done, install **pgAdmin** to manage your PostgreSQL database.
   
2. **Create Database and Table**:
   - Use pgAdmin to create a new database (e.g., `iot_telemetry_db`).
   - Create a table with columns to store telemetry data like `timestamp`, `device_id`, `temperature`, `humidity`, etc.

---

### Step 6: Configure AWS Step Functions

1. **Go to Step Functions Console**:
   - Navigate to the [AWS Step Functions console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/states).
   
2. **Create State Machine**:
   - Click **Create State Machine**.
   - Choose **Author with code editor**.
   - Define the states for your workflow:
     - **State 1: Data Extraction** – Trigger the `DataExtractionFunction`.
     - **State 2: Data Transformation** – Trigger the `DataTransformationFunction`.
     - **State 3: Data Loading** – Trigger the `DataLoadingFunction`.
   
3. **Error Handling and Retries**:
   - Implement error handling in Step Functions for each state.
   - Use **Retry** and **Catch** to handle failed tasks and retries if a state fails.

4. **Save and Test**:
   - Once the state machine is created, test the workflow by triggering data uploads.

### Step 7: Monitor and Log the ETL Workflow

1. **Enable CloudWatch Logging**:
   - For each Lambda function, enable **CloudWatch Logs** so you can monitor logs for successful runs or errors.
   - For Step Functions, enable logging to track the state machine execution.

2. **Set Up CloudWatch Alarms**:
   - Configure **CloudWatch Alarms** to notify you if there are issues in the pipeline, such as function errors or latency problems.

---

### Step 8: Test the ETL Pipeline

1. **Upload Sample Data**:
   - Upload sample telemetry data to your S3 bucket to trigger the ETL pipeline.
   
2. **Monitor the Execution**:
   - Check the Step Functions console to see how the data moves through each state.
   - Review the logs in **CloudWatch** for insights into the ETL process.

3. **Verify Data Loading**:
   - After the ETL pipeline completes, log into **pgAdmin** and verify that the processed telemetry data has been loaded into your PostgreSQL database.

---

### Step 9: Add Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Data Validation**:
   - Add validation steps in Lambda functions to ensure data integrity before loading it into the database.

2. **Real-Time Analytics**:
   - Integrate Amazon QuickSight or other data visualization tools for real-time reporting and analytics.

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement encryption for data stored in S3 and in transit between Lambda, IoT Core, and other services.
